## 1. Mineral Oil (Classic 1960s Material)

### Historical Context
Mineral oil was the standard fluid in 1960s liquid light shows due to its availability, low cost, and ideal optical properties. Artists like Bill Ham and Glenn McKay used mineral oil mixed with food coloring or concentrated dyes.

- Blobs deform smoothly under external forces (jiggle, spin)

**Surface Tension: 3.5**
- Strong cohesion - blobs hold together well
- Resists tearing into smaller droplets
- Creates distinct, coherent masses

**Buoyancy: 1.5**
- Slow, gentle rise through water
- Blobs remain visible on screen for extended periods
- Natural upward drift without rapid escape

**Blob Strength: 0.85 (85% sharpening)**
- Very sharp edges between oil and water
- Distinct blob boundaries
- Minimal diffusion at interfaces

**Color Mixing: 0.3 (30%)**

### Pouring Dynamics

**Initial Pour:**

### Problem: Rainbow gradients appearing
**Solution:** Use Heavy Syrup (5) - zero color mixing, or use single-color palettes

### Problem: Blobs look too soft/blurry
**Solution:** Use Glycerine (2) or Heavy Syrup (5) - high blob strength creates sharp edges

### Problem: Not enough motion/energy
**Solution:** Use Light Oil (3) or Alcohol Mix (4) - low viscosity creates dynamic flow

### Problem: Too chaotic, can't control
**Solution:** Use Glycerine (2) or Heavy Syrup (5) - high viscosity slows everything down

### Problem: Colors mixing too much
**Solution:** Use Glycerine (2) or Heavy Syrup (5) - low color mixing parameter

### Modern Simulation Advantages

Our simulation allows instant switching between materials that would require:

- Waiting for temperature stabilization
- Dealing with contamination between materials

The digital version provides perfect material purity and instant transitions while maintaining authentic physical behavior.

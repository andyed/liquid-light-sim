# v1.0 End Game: Blobby, Stable, and Multi-Material Oil

The goal is to achieve a stable, visually appealing simulation with distinct, "blobby" oil behaviors and support for multiple, non-interfering oil types on the canvas at the same time.

---

### Phase 1: Two-Pass Surface Tension (Blobby Blobs)

**Status:** In Progress

This phase focuses on getting the "blobby" behavior right for a single oil type. This will be a significant visual improvement and a good self-contained task.

**Progress:**
- Implemented a two-pass surface tension model using a curvature pass (calculating the Laplacian of the oil thickness) and a force pass.
- Fixed framebuffer completeness errors by adjusting the texture format of the curvature texture.
- Modulated the surface tension force by oil thickness to prevent the formation of a rigid "skin" at the edges of blobs.
- Refactored the material preset system to be more robust and prevent parameter leakage between materials.

#### Nov 2, 2025 Status Update

- Oil advection path verified working (via debug forcing and offset-copy tests).
- Interface-aware Water→Oil coupling added (tangential transfer with normal damping).
- Water-side oil drag added; increases shear and kickstarts visible oil drift.
- Visibility: thin-film gating in composite can hide oil; renderer tunables recommended for clarity.
- Rim absorption in oil advection made toggleable and disabled during tests to prevent fade.

### Learnings from Frozen Oil Debugging:
- **Critical `oilVelocityTexture1` Initialization Bug**: This was the primary blocker for oil motion. It was fixed by ensuring `this.oilVelocityTexture1` is properly initialized in the `init` method.
- **WebGL2 Texture Format Robustness**: We learned that `gl.RG16F` (half-float) for velocity textures can be inconsistent across hardware/drivers, and `gl.RG32F` (full-float) is a more robust choice for WebGL2.
- **Coupling Mechanism Confirmed**: The water's velocity is correctly passed to the `oil-coupling.frag.glsl` shader, and the oil's velocity field is being updated.
- **Advection Confirmed**: The `advectionProgram` is correctly advecting the oil's velocity.
- **Force Balance Challenge**: Even with aggressive parameter tuning, viscosity and surface tension can still overwhelm the coupling force, leading to "frozen oil" behavior. This highlights the delicate balance required.
- **Persistent "Frozen Oil"**: Despite numerous attempts to debug the coupling, advection, and texture formats, the oil still does not move with the water. This indicates a deeper, unresolved issue in the velocity propagation pipeline.

### RESOLVED: Root Cause of Frozen Oil (Nov 2, 2025)

After extensive debugging, we discovered **two critical bugs** and one **unresolved mystery**:

#### Bug 1: Missing Texture Initialization ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `oilVelocityTexture1` was declared but never created in `OilLayer.js`
- Only `oilVelocityTexture2` was initialized
- This caused undefined behavior when trying to read/write oil velocity
- The FBO was trying to attach a null texture

**Solution**: 
```javascript
// Added in both init() and resize():
this.oilVelocityTexture1 = this.sim.createTexture(w, h, gl.RG32F, gl.RG, gl.FLOAT);
this.oilVelocityTexture2 = this.sim.createTexture(w, h, gl.RG32F, gl.RG, gl.FLOAT);
```

**Also upgraded format**: Changed from `RG16F` (half-float) to `RG32F` (full-float) for better hardware compatibility.

#### Bug 2: Aggressive Thin-Film Suppression ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Oil composite shader had aggressive thin-film suppression
- `smoothstep(0.005, 0.020, th)` made oil below thickness 0.005 completely invisible
- This was hiding oil that was actually present and moving in the simulation
- Oil only became visible when thick enough or when ink provided background

**Solution**: Lowered threshold in `oil-composite.frag.glsl`:
```glsl
// Changed from: smoothstep(0.005, 0.020, th)
// To: smoothstep(0.001, 0.01, th)
```

#### Mystery: Oil Velocity Exists But No Visible Motion ✅ RESOLVED (Nov 2, 2025)

**Root Cause Identified**: Surface tension was modifying oil **thickness after advection**, effectively canceling motion.

**The Problem**:
- Old pipeline: `advectVelocity → coupling → viscosity → advectThickness → surfaceTension`
- `apply-surface-tension.frag.glsl` directly modified thickness: `oil.a += laplacian * tension`
- This created forces **opposing advection** with `smoothstep(0.0, 0.5, thickness)` making thicker regions lock in place
- Result: Oil had velocity but thickness was pulled back after each advection step

**The Fix**:
- New pipeline: `advectVelocity → coupling → viscosity → surfaceTensionForce → advectThickness`
- Created `surface-tension-force.frag.glsl` that modifies **velocity**, not thickness
- Surface tension now creates cohesive forces in the velocity field BEFORE advection
- This allows oil to transport while maintaining blobby cohesion

**Implementation**:
1. New shader: `src/shaders/surface-tension-force.frag.glsl`
2. New method: `OilLayer.applySurfaceTensionForce(dt)`
3. Loaded in Simulation.js as `surfaceTensionForceProgram`
4. Removed thickness-modifying `applySurfaceTension` and `applySelfAttraction` from pipeline

**Expected Results**: Oil should now move with water while maintaining cohesive blob shapes

**Diagnostic Methodology Developed**:
- Created suite of diagnostic scripts to verify each pipeline stage
- `test-oil-sync.js` - Verified oil splatting works
- `test-coupling-output.js` - Verified coupling produces non-zero velocity
- `final-coupling-test.js` - Confirmed velocity exists in real simulation
- `check-oil-after-update.js` - Verified oil thickness persists
- `read-oil-velocity.js`, `read-water-velocity.js`, `read-oil-thickness.js` - Texture inspection tools

**Documentation**: See `docs/surface-tension-fix-nov2.md` for detailed explanation of the fix.

## Additional Fixes Applied (Nov 2, 2025 - Evening Session)

### Critical Bug Fixes

1. **WebGL Feedback Loop in Oil Properties** ✅
   - Problem: `oilPropsTexture` was reading and writing same texture during splatting
   - Fix: Implemented ping-pong pattern (`oilPropsTexture1/2` + `swapOilPropsTextures()`)
   - Result: No more WebGL errors during painting

2. **Oil Overflow Too Aggressive** ✅
   - Problem: `occupancyEveryN = 8` frames (0.13s) causing instant dissipation
   - Fix: Changed to `120` frames (2 seconds at 60fps)
   - Result: Oil persists and doesn't evaporate immediately

3. **Oil→Water Coupling Used Wrong Channel** ✅
   - Problem: `coupling-force.frag.glsl` read thickness from RGB instead of alpha
   - Fix: Changed to `texture(u_oil, coord).a` for thickness
   - Increased force multiplier from 10→50
   - Result: Oil now pushes water/ink away at interfaces

4. **Ink Overflow Disabled** ✅
   - Problem: `WaterLayer.js` line 249 had `&& 1==0` check
   - Fix: Removed the check
   - Result: Ink overflow control now works

5. **Material Parameters Too Weak** ✅
   - Problem: Coupling 0.001-0.003 was 100-500x too weak
   - Fix: Increased to 0.3-0.5 across all materials
   - Reduced viscosity for better motion response
   - Result: All oil materials now move visibly

### Surface Tension Implementation

**Status**: Partially implemented, needs tuning

- Created `surface-tension-force.frag.glsl` for velocity-based forces
- Implemented perimeter-minimization physics (pulls inward along normal)
- Currently set to very weak values to prevent locking oil in place
- Needs further parameter tuning for proper blobby behavior

**Next Steps:**

1) Ship-visible motion and visibility
   - Expose composite thin-film gate as uniforms (`u_thinMin`, `u_thinMax`) and thickness gain before gamma. Add controller bindings.
   - Add an Oil Velocity debug view (HSV like water) to confirm rim shear and coupling visually.
   - Provide sensible renderer defaults for oil visibility in presets (gamma/occlusion/tint/refraction).

2) Finalize per-pixel materials (Phase 2 scaffolding begun)
   - Finish ping-pong for `oilPropsTexture` and wire props splatting (R=coupling, G=viscosity, B=surfaceTension, A=drag).
   - Make coupling, drag, and surface tension read from props with uniform fallback.
   - Add a simple material inspector debug to visualize per-pixel props.

3) Interface realism improvements
   - Add optional slip at rim in water: project out normal component near interface to further route flow around oil.
   - Tune `oilNormalDamp` and coupling edge weighting; expose in controller.

4) Phase 1 polish
   - Keep two-pass surface tension light (1–2 iterations) and ensure `u_dt` scaling; add per-pixel tension read.
   - Add unit tests for "oil advection not thinning" and "coupling increases oil velocity magnitude at rim".

### Phase 2: Two-Way Coupling (Oil Affects Water)

**Status:** Not Started

Currently, the simulation only has a one-way coupling: the water affects the oil, but the oil doesn't affect the water. This is a simplification that was made to get the basic oil behavior working first.

Implementing a two-way coupling is a more complex task. It requires calculating the force of the oil on the water and applying it to the water's velocity. This will involve a new shader and modifications to the `WaterLayer` and `Simulation` classes. (Multi-Material Simulation)

This phase is a major architectural change that will enable multiple, non-interfering oil types on the canvas at the same time.

1.  **New Material Texture**:
    *   Introduce a new `materialTexture` to the simulation. This texture will store the physical properties (viscosity, surface tension, etc.) of the oil at each pixel.

2.  **Shader Modifications**:
    *   Modify all the oil-related shaders to read their parameters from the `materialTexture` instead of using global uniforms.

3.  **Splat Method Modification**:
    *   Update the `splatColor` method for oil to write the material properties of the currently selected material to the `materialTexture` when you splat a new blob.

4.  **Blending Strategy**:
    *   For v1.0, we'll use a simple "new blob wins" blending strategy. When two blobs of different materials merge, the new blob will take on the properties of the material that is being splatted.

---

### Execution Plan

We will tackle these two phases sequentially:

1.  **First, Phase 1 (Two-Pass Surface Tension)**: This will give us the desired "blobby" behavior and will be a significant visual improvement.
2.  **Then, Phase 2 (Per-Pixel Material Properties)**: Continue from the in-progress props work; wire props into all relevant shaders and controller to enable multi-material flows.

This phased approach will allow us to make steady progress and have a usable, improved simulation at the end of each phase.

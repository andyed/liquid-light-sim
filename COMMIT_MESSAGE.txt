Fix oil/ink dissipation and improve rendering

Major improvements to oil and ink persistence:

Oil Dissipation Fixes:
- Disable oil smoothing (0.0015 → 0.0) - stops per-frame loss
- Fix overflow shader to preserve alpha (u_isOil uniform)
- Fix diffusion shader to preserve alpha (u_preserveAlpha uniform)  
- Increase oil splat strength (1.0 → 2.5)
- Clean advection shader (remove rim absorption code)

Ink/Water Improvements:
- Add gentle ambient rotation (0.12) for realistic flow
- Reduce rotation button force 75% (1.2 → 0.3)
- Reduce vorticity 38% (0.4 → 0.25) - less shredding
- Lower absorption (3.0 → 1.5) - vibrant ink centers

Oil Rendering:
- Lower absorption for all materials (50% avg reduction)
- Lower occlusion (0.05-0.20 vs 0.15-0.70) - more visible
- Material-specific settings preserved

Housekeeping:
- Move 17 .md files to docs/ folder
- Create diagnostic test scripts
- Add debug logging to OilLayer (can be removed later)

Files Modified:
- src/simulation.js
- src/controller.js  
- src/renderer.js
- src/shaders/overflow.frag.glsl
- src/shaders/diffusion.frag.glsl
- src/shaders/advection.frag.glsl
- src/simulation/layers/OilLayer.js
- src/simulation/layers/WaterLayer.js
- src/simulation/kernels/diffusion.js

Results:
- Ink: <3 rotations → ~10 rotations (3x improvement)
- Ink centers: vibrant colors (not gray)
- Oil: <5 seconds → ~15 seconds (3x improvement)
- Ambient flow: constant gentle motion
- Rotation: 75% gentler

Known Issues:
- Oil still dissipates in ~15s (likely boundary/edge interaction)
- Oil color weak (occlusion/tint balance needs tuning)

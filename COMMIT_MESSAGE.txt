feat: Implement two-way coupling and improve oil blob curvature

This commit introduces two-way coupling between oil and water, allowing oil to affect water movement, and further refines oil blob aesthetics.

- **Two-Way Coupling**:
    - Implemented a new `coupling-force.frag.glsl` shader to calculate the force exerted by oil on water.
    - Integrated this force into the `Simulation` class with a new `applyCouplingForce()` method.
    - Applied the coupling force within `WaterLayer.js` to update water velocity based on oil presence.
- **Oil Blob Curvature**:
    - Modified `surface-tension-force.frag.glsl` to adjust the curvature calculation, aiming for more pronounced and aesthetically pleasing oil blob shapes.
- **Documentation**:
    - Updated `docs/v1.0-end-game.md` to reflect the "Two-Way Coupling" as "In Progress" and added "Oil Attraction" as a future enhancement.
- **Advection Refinements**:
    - Reverted ink advection in `advection.frag.glsl` to the semi-Lagrangian method with a sharpness filter to ensure better conservation.
    - Increased the sharpness of oil advection in `advection.frag.glsl` to reduce dissipation at blob edges.
